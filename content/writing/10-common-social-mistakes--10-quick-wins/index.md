Hey!

Welcome back to Day 3 with the Social Selling Newsletter.

This is Matthew.

Today I promise you will leave with **at least 1 tangible takeaway.**

I'm going to cover:

*   **10 common X and LinkedIn mistakes** you can stop immediately

*   **10 quick wins** you can get on X and LinkedIn

I'm all about those quick wins.

Remember...learning something means changing your behavior, so as you read through, think about what behavior you will change.

# 10 common social media mistakes

**1/ Stop using hashtags:** they are a thing of the past.

**2/ No educational content:** I see many creators posting 280-character "tweets" on LinkedIn. You'll get 5x the rewards for making the content 3x longer and 3x deeper. The other mistake here I see is people leaning into entertaining content with no educational value. You get views but not sales.

**3/ No media:** You need images and videos in 2025 and beyond. Text-based platforms now require media if you want to succeed.

**4/ Clunky paragraphs:** Make your content easy to read. I shoot for a 4th grade reading level and introduce a ton of white space. If you are confronted with a thick paragraph, you'll probably skip it (and so will your readers).

**5/ Too many links:** When you link off-platform, the social media algorithm automatically penalizes your post. Think about it...they make money when people stay on the platform. So you need to be strategic about getting people into your email ecosystem.

**6/ Never check the data:** Content is a data-driven game. It's all about figuring out what's working and doubling down. This works for hooks, content ideas, topics, and post formats.

**7/ Using fake engagement:** I get why people want to use engagement groups. It's painful to get 0 likes. But long-term, this hurts you--the more organic your engagements, the better long-term prospects your account will have.

**8/ Breaking promises with your hooks:** One problem with the internet is it gets more and more sensationalized because people are competing for clicks. If you overpromise and underdeliver, you lose readers forever. So absolutely write good hooks. Just make sure you can deliver on them.

**9/ Keeping people on social media:** Social media platforms are volatile and thousands of people have gone out of business depending on them but getting let down. To decrease risk, get people onto an owned platform like email or podcast.

**10/ No proof of work:** If you are a writer, write. If you are a CFO, build reports. If you are a web designer, show designs. The easiest way to prove expertise is to show people you're an expert publicly with your posts.

# 10 quick social media wins

**1/ Get verified:** LinkedIn claims an increase of 60% visitors to your profile *just* by getting verified. On X, you have to pay to get verified, but your comments rise to the top, your posts are more viewed, and people take you more seriously.

**2/ Get a clean profile:** If someone new comes to your profile, they should be able to tell what you do and who you help within 3 seconds. If they can't, you've lost already. Use simple words and ooze credibility.

**3/ Steal these proven hooks:** (1) [101 proven hook templates](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5u6d8dkxku0up965ndc8h8rgp222cl/08hwh9h20n5z44al/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xMDhYZ2pBd29PYnEtbkw2U3lKRHR3UTJUcmNGR3RkTEw2c0dkYjI3UjE5US9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n), (2) [51 headlines formulas that work.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5u6d8dkxku0up965ndc8h8rgp222cl/8ghqhohoewv984ck/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xSUxUM19rajZDM1R0OUJYcTNBM2tHLWFuR0tyNS0tdUlWZDZwejVNc2tnUS9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n)

**4/ Call-to-actions:** On X, use autoplugs. 98% of clicks come from autoplugs compared to the links in your profile. On LinkedIn, use a custom button so your CTA shows up under your face on all your posts. Also add your main CTA to your featured section.

**5/ Follow the rule of one:** Only ask for 1 call-to-action at a time. This goes for specific posts you create, your opt-in landing page, and so on.

**6/ Re-introduce yourself 1x per month:** People follow you but forget who you are. Don't take it personally, it's just a fact. So regularly re-introduce yourself so your audience doesn't go stale. This is how you engage and re-engage your followers. By the way, I have a ton of data that this works.

**8/ Media templates you can steal for LinkedIn:** I've noticed that adding relevant media increases reach by 30%+ on LinkedIn. Not to mention engagement. [I had a designer make these templates you can instantly use.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5u6d8dkxku0up965ndc8h8rgp222cl/z2hghnhe95vwgoup/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2lzZWQtYmVhcmQtOGI4Lm5vdGlvbi5zaXRlL01lZGlhLUdyYXBoaWMtVGVtcGxhdGVzLVRvLUdyb3ctWW91ci1MaW5rZWRJbi1Jbi0yMDI1LTE4NTdkMTAwNGU0NjgwMTU4YWMyZjZiMWMzYWMxMzNlP3B2cz00)

**9/ Send 200 connection requests weekly:** If you write to business owners but no business owners follow you, do you really expect them to engage with your posts? Send connection requests so they follow you and see the posts. You need a base level of engagement to consistently grow from content.

**10/ Send a welcome DM to new followers:** When people follow/connect with you, drop them a DM. Say their name, say what you do, and link to a few of your best pieces of content so they can get a feel for what you talk about. Easy way to build affinity.

That's it!

Hopefully you got AT LEAST 1 thing from this that you can immediately implement.
